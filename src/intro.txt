What is React
 - What is React


React?
  - Just an un-opinionated front-end library 
  - Helps you with the nitty gritty stuff of rendering an interactive page

  This results in a convenient code base -> markup and logic in one(?) language



HTML - How you describe the structure of a page
DOM - How the browser represents your structure in memory 

Virtual-Virtual HTML
 - Vitural DOM: lightweight version of the DOM itself
        - React manipulates this first and then reconciles the real DOM to the updated
        virtual one using their own diffing algorithm
        - This allows for a better developer convenience 


JS and HTML? -> JSX

Components
- Smallest unit of React
- Node in the Tree
- Can be nested with child Components
- Renders "HTML" to the page

How do you make this all interactive?
 - States!
